This work is related to my paper called 'Multi-Objective Workflow Scheduling With Deep-Q-Network-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning', which proposed a novel method for scientific workflow scheduling over heterogeneous virtual machines. Based on the previous algorithm framework, i firstly attempt to utilize the dataset from real-world to train the model and obtain the trend of rewards.
