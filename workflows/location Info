LIGO Inspiral Analysis Workflow
The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) is attempting to detect gravitational waves produced by various events in the universe as per Einstein's theory of general relativity. The LIGO Inspiral Analysis Workflow is used to analyze the data obtained from the coalescing of compact binary systems such as binary neutron stars and black holes. The time-frequency data from any event for each of the three LIGO detectors is split into smaller blocks for analysis. For each block, the workflow generates a subset of waveforms belonging to the parameter space and computes the matched filter output. If a true inspiral has been detected, a trigger is generated that can then be checked with triggers for the other detectors. Several additional consistency tests may also be performed.
LIGO operates two gravitational wave observatories in unison: the LIGO Livingston Observatory in Livingston, Louisiana, and the LIGO Hanford Observatory, on the DOE Hanford Site), located near Richland,

Montage
Montage has been created by the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive as an open source toolkit that can be used to generate custom mosaics of the sky using input images in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) format. During the production of the final mosaic, the geometry of the output is calculated from the geometry of the input images. The inputs are then re-projected to be of the same spatial scale and rotation. The background emissions in the images are then corrected to be of the same level in all images. The re-projected, corrected images are co-added to form the final mosaic. The Montage application has been represented as a workflow that can be executed in Grid environments such as the TeraGrid.

SIPHT
The bioinformatics project at Harvard University is conducting a wide search for small untranslated RNAs (sRNAs) that regulate several processes such as secretion or virulence in bacteria. The sRNA identification protocol using high-throughput technology (SIPHT) program uses a workflow to automate the search for sRNA encoding-genes for all of the bacterial replicons in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The kingdom-wide prediction and annotation of sRNA encoding genes involves a variety of individual programs that are executed in the proper order using Condor DAGMan's capabilities. These involve the prediction of Rho-independent transcriptional terminators, BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tools) comparisons of the inter genetic regions of different replicons and the annotations of any sRNAs that are found.
